 This is a container that lifts a sub-state middleware to a global state middleware.

 Internally you find the middleware responsible for handling events and actions for a sub-state (`Part`), while this outer class will be able to compose with global state (`Whole`) in your `Store`.

 You should not be able to instantiate this class directly, instead, create a middleware for the sub-state and call `Middleware.lift(_:)`, passing as parameter the keyPath from whole to part.

extension Middleware {
    /**
     A lenses method. The global state of your app is *Whole*, and the `Middleware` handles *Part*, that is a sub-state.
     So for example you may want to have a `GPSMiddleware` that knows about the following `struct`:
     ```
     struct Location {
        let latitude: Double
        let longitude: Double
     }
     ```

     Let's call it `Part`. Both, this state and its middleware will be part of an external framework, used by dozens of apps. Internally probably the `Middleware` will use `CoreLocation` to fetch the GPS changes, and triggers some actions. On the main app we have a global state, that we now call `Whole`.

     ```
     struct MyGlobalState {
        let title: String?
        let listOfItems: [Item]
        let currentLocation: Location
     }
     ```

     As expected, `Part` is a property of `Whole`, maybe not directly, it could be several nodes deep in the tree.

     Because our `Store` understands `Whole` and our `GPSMiddleware` understands `Part`, we must `lift(_:)` the middleware to the `Whole` level, by using:

     ```
     let globalStateMiddleware = gpsMiddleware.lift(\MyGlobalState.currentLocation)
     ```

     Now this middleware can be used within our `Store` or even composed with others. It also can be used in other apps as long as we have a way to lift it to the world of `Whole`.

     - Parameter substatePath: the keyPath that goes from `Whole` to `Part`
     - Returns: a `SubstateMiddleware``<Whole, Self>` that knows how to translate `Whole` to `Part` and vice-versa, by using the key path.

        return SubstateMiddleware<Whole, Self>(middleware: self) { getWholeState in {

            }
