/**
 The `ComposedMiddleware` is a container of inner middlewares that are chained together in the order as they were composed. Whenever an `EventProtocol` or an `ActionProtocol` arrives to be handled by this `ComposedMiddleware`, it will delegate to its internal chain of middlewares.

 It could be initialized manually by using the `init()` and configured by using the method `append(middleware:)`, but if you're ok with using custom operators you can compose two or more middlewares using the diamond operator:

 ```
 let composedMiddleware = firstMiddleware <> secondMiddleware <> thirdMiddleware
 ```

     The internal middlewares in this `ComposedMiddleware` container may trigger side-effects, may trigger actions, may start an asynchronous operation.

     - Parameters:
       - event: the event to be handled
       - getState: a function that can be used to get the current state at any point in time

     The internal middlewares in this `ComposedMiddleware` container may change the `ActionProtocol` or trigger additional ones. Usually this is not the best place to start side-effects or trigger new actions, it should be more as an observation point for tracking, logging and telemetry.
     - Parameters:
       - action: the action to be handled
       - getState: a function that can be used to get the current state at any point in time
       - next: the next `Middleware` in the chain, probably we want to call this method in some point of our method (not necessarily in the end. When this is the last middleware in the pipeline, the next function will call the `Reducer` pipeline.

/**
 Initializes a `ComposedMiddleware` from the `lhs` and `rhs` middlewares parameters, or appends to the `lhs` if it is already a `ComposedMiddleware`, as shown below:

 ```
 let composedOfThreeMiddlewares = composedOfTwoMiddlewares <> thirdMiddleware
 ```

 Or

 ```

 ```

 Or

 ```
 let composedMiddlewares = firstMiddleware <> secondMiddleware
 _ = composedMiddlewares <> thirdMiddleware
 // assert(composedMiddlewares == firstMiddleware <> secondMiddleware <> thirdMiddleware)
 ```

 - Parameters:
   - lhs: A flat middleware or a composed middleware, in case it's a flat one, this operation will create a new `ComposedMiddleware` and return it, otherwise it will append the `rhs` to this composed lhs one mutating it and also returning it.
   - rhs: A flat middleware to be appended to the end of a `ComposedMiddleware`
 - Returns: A `ComposedMiddleware` that calls the `lhs` methods before the `rhs` ones. If `lhs` is already a `ComposedMiddleware`, we will return the same instance after mutating it to have the `rhs` in the end of its chain.
