/**
 The `DirectLineMiddleware` is a useful tool when you have a very simple `EventProtocol` that is also an `ActionProtocol` and no decision has to be made other than forwarding the event as it is to the action queue.

 If the incoming `EventProtocol` is not an `ActionProtocol`, this middleware will act like `BypassMiddleware`, simply forwarding it to the next middleware in the chain.

 For example:
 ```
 enum CounterEvent: EventProtocol, ActionProtocol {
     case increment, decrement
 }
 ```

 When this `CounterEvent` is dispatched to the store, thanks to a `DirectLineMiddleware` it will be forwarded to the `Reducer` without any explicit handling. So you can have a reducer that understands `CounterEvent` and use it to calculate the new `State`.

 This can be really convenient for very simple actions.

     A `Middleware` is capable of triggering `ActionProtocol` to the `Store`. This property is a nullable `ActionHandler` used for the middleware to trigger the actions.
