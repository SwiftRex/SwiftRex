/**
 🏪 `Store` defines a protocol for the state store of an app. It must have an input and an output:
 - an `EventHandler`: that's the store input, so it's able to receive and distribute events of type `EventProtocol`. Being an event handler means that an `UIViewController` can dispatch events to it, such as `.userTappedButtonX`, `.didScrollToPosition(_:)`, `.viewDidLoad` or `queryTextFieldChangedTo(_:)`.
 - a `StateProvider`: that's the store output, so the system can subscribe a store for updates on State. Being a state provider basically means that store is an Observable<T>, where T is the State of your app, so an `UIViewController` can subscribe to state changes and react to them.

 The store will glue all the parts together and its responsibility is being a proxy to the non-Redux world. For that reason, it's correct to say that a `Store` is the single point of contact with `UIKit` and it's a class that you want to inject as a dependency on all the ViewControllers, either as one single dependency or, preferably, a dependency for each of its protocols - `EventHandler` and `StateProvider` -, both eventually pointing to the same instance.

 You want only one Store in your app, so either you create a singleton or a public property in a long-life class such as AppDelegate or AppCoordinator. That's crucial for making the store completely detached from the `UIKit` world. Theoretically it should be possible to keep multiple stores - one per module or per `UIViewController` - and keep them in sync through Rx observation, like the "Flux" approach. However, the main goal of SwiftRex is to keep an unified state independent from `UIKit`, therefore it's the recommended approach.

 Specific implementations of a store will require mechanisms to distribute events, mutate the state and notifies subscribers, probably by using `Middleware` and being an `ActionHandler` too, but this is not necessary for the outside world, that only needs the input and output bus of a store.

 Please check (and inherit from) `StoreBase` for a standard implementation.
