// MARK: - liftCollection (primitive — AffineTraversal)
//
// Lifts a per-element `Middleware` into one that operates on a whole collection living inside a
// global state. `Middleware` is read-only on state, so — unlike ``Behavior/liftCollection`` —
// there is no mutation to lift; only the effect side is transformed. Two extra pieces beyond the
// state traversal are still needed:
//
//   • `embed` — re-wraps an action emitted by an element's effect back into the global action
//     type, so it can re-enter the ``Store`` addressed at the same element.
//   • the element `id` — used to scope each element's effect-scheduling ids.
//
// ## Per-element effect-scheduling isolation
//
// Every lifted element shares the same `Middleware`, so two elements would otherwise collide on
// any ``EffectScheduling`` id. `liftCollection` rewrites each element's scheduling ids to
// `ElementScopedID(element: id, …)`, so element A's `.debounce(id: .fetch)` is independent of
// element B's. The user keeps owning the inner id; cross-feature collisions remain theirs to
// prevent (use distinct id enums), exactly as for un-lifted effects.
