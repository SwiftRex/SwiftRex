/// Observes dispatched actions and produces side effects without mutating state.
///
/// `Middleware` is the pure, side-effect-producing half of a feature's logic. It receives every
/// dispatched action together with a lazy read-only view of the current state, and returns a
/// `Reader<Environment, Effect<Action>>` — a deferred effect that the ``Store`` will schedule in
/// phase 3 of dispatch, after all state mutations have completed.
///
/// ```
/// dispatch         Middleware.handle                 Reader runs (phase 3, post-mutation)
///    │                    │                                    │
///    ▼                    ▼                                    ▼
/// Action ──► state.snapshotState() = pre-mutation    state.snapshotState() = post-mutation
///                          └──► Reader<Environment, Effect<Action>>
///                                         └──► environment injected by Store
/// ```
///
/// ## Single action type
///
/// `Middleware<Action, State, Environment>` uses a single `Action` type for both incoming and
/// outgoing actions. To narrow the action scope, use ``liftAction(_:)`` with a `Prism` — actions
/// not matched by the prism are silently ignored, and produced actions are wrapped through the
/// prism's `review` function before re-entering the Store.
///
/// ## Always @MainActor
///
/// The ``Store`` is `@MainActor`, so `handle` is always called on the main actor. This lets
/// middleware call `stateAccess.snapshotState()` directly (also `@MainActor`) and keeps state
/// reads safe by construction, with no manual actor-hopping required.
///
/// ## Middleware is stateless
///
/// `Middleware` holds no instance state. Patterns that seem to require state — debouncing,
/// throttling, keeping track of in-flight requests — are expressed as ``EffectScheduling``
/// directives on the returned ``Effect``. The Store manages all lifecycle state.
///
/// ```swift
/// // Debounce without instance state on the middleware
/// Middleware<SearchAction, SearchState, SearchEnvironment> { action, _ in
///     guard case .queryChanged(let q) = action.action else {
///         return Reader { _ in .empty }
///     }
///     return Reader { env in
///         env.api.search(q).asEffect()
///             .scheduling(.debounce(id: "search", delay: 0.3))
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Pre- and post-mutation state
///
/// The same `StateAccess` reference yields different values depending on when it is called:
///
/// ```swift
/// Middleware<MyAction, MyState, MyEnvironment> { action, state in
///     let pre = state.snapshotState()    // pre-mutation state (phase 1)
///
///     return Reader { env in
///         let post = state.snapshotState()  // post-mutation state (phase 3)
///         return .just(.log(before: pre, after: post))
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Composition
///
/// `Middleware` is a **Semigroup** and **Monoid**. ``combine(_:_:)`` gives both middlewares the
/// same action and state access; their effects are merged via ``Effect/combine(_:_:)`` and run
/// concurrently. Order does not affect what each middleware observes.
///
/// ## Lifting
///
/// Feature middlewares operate on local types. Use the lift family to embed them in the app's
/// global types:
///
/// - ``liftAction(_:)`` — narrows via a `Prism`
/// - ``liftState(_:)-9kjxz`` — widens via a getter closure
/// - ``liftState(_:)-5j4jz`` — widens via a `Lens`
/// - ``liftState(_:)-3cpnb`` — widens via a `Prism` (optional enum state)
/// - ``liftState(_:)-4f8n1`` — widens via an `AffineTraversal`
/// - ``liftEnvironment(_:)`` — narrows via a projection closure
/// - ``lift(action:state:environment:)-5ttmj`` and overloads — all three axes at once

    /// `Reader` that the Store will run in phase 3 (post-mutation) to obtain the ``Effect``.
    ///

    /// - **Phase 3**: The returned `Reader` is run with the environment after all mutations
