/**
 This is a container that lifts a sub-state middleware to a global state middleware.

 Internally you find the middleware responsible for handling events and actions for a sub-state (`Part`), while this outer class will be able to compose with global state (`Whole`) in your `Store`.

 You should not be able to instantiate this class directly, instead, create a middleware for the sub-state and call `Middleware.lift(_:)`, passing as parameter the keyPath from whole to part.

     Handles the incoming actions and may or not start async tasks, check the latest state at any point or dispatch
     additional actions. This is also a good place for analytics, tracking, logging and telemetry. Because the lift
     middleware is derived from a sub-state/sub-action middleware, every global action received will be mapped into
     a sub-action, in a operation that can return nil (`Optional<SubAction>`). In case it's nil, it means that the
     sub-action middleware doesn't work with this type of action, so the lifted middleware will simply call the next
     middleware in the chain. On the other hand, if this operation returns a non-nil local action, this local action will
     be handled by the child middleware, which is also responsible for calling `next()` in this case. When the `State`
     type is also lifted, the context property will translate the global state into local state as expected every time
     you call `context().getState()`.
     - Parameters:
       - action: the action to be handled
       - dispatcher: information about the file, line and function that dispatched this action
       - state: a closure to obtain the most recent state
     - Returns: possible Side-Effects wrapped in an IO struct
