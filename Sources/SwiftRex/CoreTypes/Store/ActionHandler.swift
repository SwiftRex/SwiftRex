/**
 `ActionHandler` defines a protocol for entities able to handle actions - defined by the associated type `ActionType`.

 The only protocol requirement is a function that allows other entities to dispatch actions, so Views (or Presenters,
 ViewModels) in your UI layer, or even Middlewares can create actions of a certain type and send to your store, that
 is generalized by this protocol.
