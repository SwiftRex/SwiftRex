/// ⛓ `Middleware` is a plugin, or a composition of several plugins, that are assigned to the `ReduxStoreProtocol` pipeline in order to handle each
/// action received (`InputActionType`), to execute side-effects in response, and eventually dispatch more actions (`OutputActionType`) in the process.
/// This happens before the `Reducer` to do its job.
///
/// We can think of a Middleware as an object that transforms actions into sync or async tasks and create more actions as these side-effects complete,
/// also being able to check the current state at any point.
///
/// An action is a lightweight structure, typically an enum, that is dispatched into the `ActionHandler` (usually a `StoreProtocol`).
/// A Store like `ReduxStoreProtocol` enqueues a new action that arrives and submits it to a pipeline of middlewares. So, in other words, a `Middleware`
/// is class that handles actions, and has the power to dispatch more actions to the `ActionHandler` chain. The `Middleware` can also simply ignore the
/// action, or it can execute side-effects in response, such as logging into file or over the network, or execute http requests, for example. In case of
/// those async tasks, when they complete the middleware can dispatch new actions containing a payload with the response (a JSON file, an array of
/// movies, credentials, etc). Other middlewares will handle that, or maybe even the same middleware in a future RunLoop, or perhaps some `Reducer`, as
/// reducers pipeline is at the end of every middleware pipeline.
///
/// Middlewares can schedule a callback to be executed after the reducer pipeline is done mutating the global state. At that point, the middleware
/// will have access to the new state, and in case it cached the old state it can compare them, log, audit, perform analytics tracking, telemetry or
/// state sync with external devices, such as Apple Watches. Remote Debugging over the network is also a great use of a Middleware.
///
/// Every action dispatched also comes with its action source, which is the primary dispatcher of that action. Middlewares can access the file, line,
/// function and additional information about the entity responsible for creating and dispatching that action, which is a very powerful debugging
/// information that can help developers to trace how the information flows through the app.
///
/// Because the `Middleware` receive all actions and accesses the state of the app at any point, anything can be done from these small and reusable
/// boxes. For example, the same `CoreLocation` middleware could be used from an iOS app, its extensions, the Apple Watch extension or even different
/// apps, as long as they share some sub-state struct.
///
/// Some suggestions of middlewares:
///
/// - Run Timers, pooling some external resource or updating some local state at a constant time
/// - Subscribe for `CoreData`, `Realm`, `Firebase Realtime Database` or equivalent database changes
/// - Be a `CoreLocation` delegate, checking for significant location changes or beacon ranges and triggering actions to update the state
/// - Be a `HealthKit` delegate to track activities, or even combining that with `CoreLocation` observation in order to track the activity route
/// - Logger, Telemetry, Auditing, Analytics tracker, Crash report breadcrumbs
/// - Monitoring or debugging tools, like external apps to monitor the state and actions remotely from a different device
/// - `WatchConnectivity` sync, keep iOS and watchOS state in sync
/// - API calls and other "cold observables"
/// - Network Reachability
/// - Navigation through the app (Redux Coordinator pattern)
/// - `CoreBluetooth` central or peripheral manager
/// - `CoreNFC` manager and delegate
/// - `NotificationCenter` and other delegates
/// - WebSocket, TCP Socket, Multipeer and many other connectivity protocols
/// - `RxSwift` observables, `ReactiveSwift` signal producers, `Combine` publishers
/// - Observation of traits changes, device rotation, language/locale, dark mode, dynamic fonts, background/foreground state
/// - Any side-effect, I/O, networking, sensors, third-party libraries that you want to abstract
///
