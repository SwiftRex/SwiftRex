/// The complete outcome of a ``Behavior`` handling one action: an optional state mutation
/// and an optional side effect.
///
/// `Consequence` is the return value of every ``Behavior/handle`` call. It pairs an
/// `EndoMut<State>` (the mutation to apply in phase 2) with a
/// `Reader<PostReducerContext<State, Environment>, Effect<Action>>`
/// (the effect to schedule in phase 3). Either half can be absent — use the static factories
/// to express intent clearly:
///
/// ```swift
/// Behavior<AppAction, AppState, AppEnvironment> { action, _ in
///     switch action {
///     case .increment:
///         // Pure mutation — no effect
///         return .reduce { $0.count += 1 }
///
///     case .fetch(let query):
///         // Pure effect — no mutation
///         return .produce { ctx in ctx.environment.api.search(query).asEffect() }
///
///     case .fetchAndShow(let query):
///         // Both: set loading flag, then fire the network request
///         return .reduce { $0.isLoading = true }
///                .produce { ctx in ctx.environment.api.search(query).asEffect() }
///
///     case .noop:
///         return .doNothing
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Three-phase dispatch timing
///
/// The ``Store`` processes a `Consequence` in three phases:
///
/// 1. **Phase 1** — ``Behavior/handle`` is called with a ``PreReducerContext`` giving access
///    to pre-mutation state. The `Consequence` is produced but nothing has changed yet.
/// 2. **Phase 2** — `mutation.runEndoMut(&state)` is called. All state changes happen here,
///    atomically, on `@MainActor`.
/// 3. **Phase 3** — `effect.runReader(postCtx)` is called. ``PostReducerContext/stateAfter``
///    now returns post-mutation state — read it via `await MainActor.run { ctx.stateAfter }`
///    or use the Combine / RxSwift / ReactiveSwift `readStateAfter()` helpers.
///
/// ## Semigroup: sequential mutations, parallel effects
///
/// ``combine(_:_:)`` runs `lhs.mutation` then `rhs.mutation` on the same `inout State`, so
/// later mutations see earlier ones. Their effects are merged via ``Effect/combine(_:_:)``
/// and run concurrently by the Store.
