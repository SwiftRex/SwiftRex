/// The sole owner of mutable `State` and the central coordinator of the three-phase dispatch pipeline.
///
/// Create one `Store` per application and pass it — or narrowed ``StoreProjection`` values — to
/// your features. The ``Store`` is `@MainActor`, so all state reads, mutations, and observer
/// notifications happen on the main thread without any manual actor-hopping.
///
/// ## Dispatch pipeline
///
/// Every dispatched action runs through these steps in `runPhases`:
///
/// ```
/// 1. behavior.handle(action, stateAccess)    — all Behaviors; stateAccess = pre-mutation state
/// 2. stateObservers.willChange fired         — ObservableObject fires objectWillChange here
///    consequence.mutation.runEndoMut(&state)  — zero-copy inout; refcount stays at 1
///    stateObservers.didChange fired           — @Observable / push-based observers
/// 3. consequence.effect.runReader(env)        — Reader runs; stateAccess = post-mutation state
/// 4. engine.schedule(component) per component — action-driven effects (produce / Cmd)
/// 5. engine.reconcile(behavior.supervisor(state)) — state-driven channels (Sub); only if state changed
/// ```
///
/// Grouping all `willChange` notifications before the mutation (and all `didChange` notifications
/// after) means observers never see a partially-mutated state. `withAnimation { store.dispatch(...) }`
/// works correctly because SwiftUI animation transactions are thread-local and the mutation lands
/// on `@MainActor` inside the transaction.
///
/// ## Serialized, never-nested processing
///
/// Actions are serialized through a FIFO `queue` guarded by an `isProcessing` flag, so
/// `runPhases` never runs nested. A synchronous ``dispatch(_:source:)`` runs its action — and
/// any actions dispatched synchronously while it runs (for example a `didChange` observer that
/// re-dispatches) — within the same run loop turn, draining the queue in order. Because the
/// pipeline is never re-entered mid-action, observers always see a fully-committed state.
///
/// Actions produced by effects re-enter through a `Task` hop (see `makeSend`), so they are
/// always processed on a later turn rather than inline — keeping effect work off the run loop
/// turn that drove the original UI dispatch.
///
/// ## Initialisation
///
/// Three convenience initialisers cover common patterns:
///
/// ```swift
/// // Full form: custom Behavior, any Environment
/// let store = Store(
///     initial: AppState.initial,
///     behavior: appBehavior,
///     environment: AppEnvironment.live
/// )
///
/// // Reducer only (Environment == Void, no side effects)
/// let store = Store(
///     initial: CounterState(),
///     reducer: counterReducer
/// )
///
/// // Separate Reducer + Middleware (composed internally)
/// let store = Store(
///     initial: AppState.initial,
///     reducer: appReducer,
///     middleware: appMiddleware,
///     environment: AppEnvironment.live
/// )
/// ```
///
/// ## Effect lifecycle
///
/// Scheduling is delegated to a shared `EffectEngine` — the same engine `TestStore` drives with a
/// controllable clock. It tracks each running `Effect.Component` keyed by ``EffectScheduling/id`` (or
/// a fresh anonymous key for id-less components), honouring `delay`, `coalesce` (debounce/throttle),
/// `exclusive` (replace), the cancel-only sentinel, and the pipeable channel path.
///
/// ``SubscriptionToken`` cancels on release, so the engine's registry behaves like a
/// `Set<AnyCancellable>`: replacing the token under a key cancels the effect it displaced, and
/// deallocating the Store releases the engine — cancelling every in-flight effect — so no explicit
/// `deinit` is needed.
///
/// Dispatching from inside an effect re-enters the pipeline on `@MainActor` via `Task`, and the
/// `isProcessing` guard defers it behind any in-progress action, so reentrancy is always safe —
/// effects never interleave with, or nest inside, an in-progress dispatch.
///
/// - Note: `@unchecked Sendable` is used because the mutable stored properties (`state`, the
///   `lazy` engine, observers, etc.) are only accessed on `@MainActor`, but Swift cannot statically
///   prove this for a `final class` without `nonisolated(unsafe)` annotations on each property.
