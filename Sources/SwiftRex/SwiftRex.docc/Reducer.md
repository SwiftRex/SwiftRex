# ``SwiftRex/Reducer``

The one place state changes — a pure function from an action to an in-place mutation.

## Overview

A `Reducer<ActionType, StateType>` maps an action to an `EndoMut<State>` — an in-place endomorphism on your state. It is the **only** layer in SwiftRex allowed to mutate state, and it does so purely: no side effects, no async work, no environment. Effects live in ``Middleware``; the two combine into a ``Behavior``.

```swift
let counter = Reducer<CounterAction, Int>.reduce { action, state in
    switch action {
    case .increment: state += 1
    case .decrement: state -= 1
    case .reset:     state = 0
    }
}
```

### Creating one

There are four `reduce` factories — pick whichever reads best; they all build the same value:

- `reduce { action, state in … }` — the idiomatic **`inout`** form (zero-copy).
- `reduce { action, state in newState }` — the **pure-return** form, converted to `inout` internally.
- `reduce { action in EndoMut { … } }` — return an `EndoMut` directly; handy when composing endomorphisms or optimising a hot path.
- `reduce { action in Endo { … } }` — the value-level `Endo` variant (bridges to `EndoMut`).

### The algebra — a sequential monoid

`Reducer` is a `Monoid`. ``combine(_:_:)`` runs `lhs` then `rhs` on the **same** `inout` state (order matters; `rhs` sees `lhs`'s change); ``identity`` mutates nothing. This is precisely the structure of `EndoMut`'s monoid lifted over actions — see <doc:Algebra>. Build composite reducers with the `@ReducerBuilder` DSL:

```swift
let app = Reducer.compose {
    counterReducer
    historyReducer            // runs after counterReducer, sees its mutation
}
```

### Scaling a feature up

A reducer written at *local* types is lifted to your app's *global* types before composing, each lift naming its axes through a ``Relay/Scope`` leading-dot builder. A reducer carries no environment, so only the `.action` and `.state` lanes matter:

- **``lift(_:)-(Relay.Scope<A.Global,A,S.Global,S,Never,Relay.Absurd<Never>>)``** — re-index the action (a `Prism`/`\.case`) and focus the state (a `WritableKeyPath`/`Lens`/`AffineTraversal`) in one scope.
- **``liftCollection(_:)-(Relay.Scope<A.Global,A,S.Global,S,Never,Relay.Absurd<Never>>)``** — route an addressed global action to **one** element of an `Identifiable`/custom-keyed collection or a dictionary; the state lane locates it (`.state(\.rows)`, `.state(\.rows, id: \.slug)`, `.state(indexed: \.rows)`, `.state(dictionary: \.configs)`).
- **``liftEach(_:)-(Relay.Scope<A.Global,A,S.Global,S,Never,Relay.Absurd<Never>>)``** — the broadcast form: apply to *every* element, the action lane bridging a plain inbound prism into the per-element ``ElementAction``.

```swift
let app = itemReducer.liftCollection(.action(AppAction.prism.row).state(\.rows))
```

In each case the lifted reducer sees the **unwrapped** element. There is no per-element effect stamping or supervision to carry — a reducer is pure — so these are the simplest of the collection hosts. A reducer has no 0-or-1 `liftOptional` host either (that lives on ``Behavior`` and ``Middleware``): an absent focus would be a no-op *mutation*, which is already ``identity`` — reach for ``liftCollection(_:)-(Relay.Scope<A.Global,A,S.Global,S,Never,Relay.Absurd<Never>>)`` or an `AffineTraversal` state lane on ``lift(_:)-(Relay.Scope<A.Global,A,S.Global,S,Never,Relay.Absurd<Never>>)`` instead. See <doc:Algebra> for why lifting composes cleanly, and ``ElementAction`` for how element actions are addressed.

### Becoming a Behavior

``asBehavior()`` turns a `Reducer` into a ``Behavior`` whose effect is always empty — the bridge for combining pure reducers with effectful middleware under one type.
