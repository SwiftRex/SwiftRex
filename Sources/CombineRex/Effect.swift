/// Effect is a Combine Publisher to be returned by Middlewares so they can dispatch Actions back to a Store.
/// Every effect will have a cancellation token to be later cancelled by new action arrivals, such as in the
/// case when the user is no longer interested in certain HTTP Request or wants to stop a timer. When
/// cancellation token is not provided during the initialization of an Effect, it still can be passed later,
/// which will rewrap the upstream again in a new Effect, but this time containing the cancellation token.
/// Some static constructors are available, such as `.doNothing`, `.just(_: Output)`, `.sequence(_: Output...)`,
/// `.sequence(_: [Output]`, `.promise(_: CompletionHandler)`, etc.
///
/// An Effect can never Fail, so any possible failure of its upstream must be caught and treated before the
/// Effect is created. For example, if you have an effect that uses URLSession to fetch some data from an URL,
/// once you get your data back you can dispatch a successful action. But in case the task returns an URLError
/// or some unexpected URLResponse, you should not fail, but instead, replace the error with an action to be
/// dispatched telling your store that the request has failed. This will enforce the usage of Actions as
/// communication units between different middlewares and reducers.
///
/// That's also the reason why `.asEffect` and `.asEffect<H: Hashable>(cancellationToken: H)` extensions are
/// only available for publishers that have `Failure == Never`.
///
/// An Effect can be a single-shot sync or async, or a long-lasting one such as a timer. That's why
/// cancellation token is so important. The option `.doNothing` is an `Empty` publisher useful for when the
/// middleware decides that certain conditions don't require any side-effect.
